  <p>Howdy! I’m a computer engineering student pursuing a master’s in finance, passionate about building robust systems at the intersection of technology and capital. My background spans software and hardware design, financial modeling, and machine learning acceleration techniques. I’m driven by the challenge of optimizing systems. Whether that means accelerating algorithms in hardware implementations or extracting maximum value from refining financial models.</p>
  <p>As a tutor, I’ve helped students increase their ACT/SAT scores with strategy development and individualized instruction. As a student leader, I’ve planned events for 100+ peers and led weekly mentorship sessions for youth groups. These experiences have deepened my commitment to connection, clarity, and long-term value creation. </p>
